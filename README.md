# pELAstic-pelagic-limnocorral-amplicon-seq
Pelagic limnocorrals were deployed in 2021–2022 at the IISD–Experimental Lakes Area to assess microbial responses to microplastics in freshwater lakes. Fully enclosed pelagic mesocosms (10 m × 2 m) were exposed to gradients of PE, PS, and PET, with microbial communities characterized using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
